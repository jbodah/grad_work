* <math.h> libraries
* 600x600, used center 300x300 (1 of 4)
* Given 8-bit image => 256 intensity values, A = 255
* Didn't try for colored. To get colored, just shift values from gaussian into right part of array (no reason to calculate gaussian 3 times)
* kept values as floats until end where I converted to ints. may have caused some rounding errors (might be able to detect in image, didn't test), but image looked pretty good

* ignored boundaries (only used pixels with 3x3 neighborhood). could've padded, etc
* bubblesort since n small and it's easy to implement
* new_image = median of sorted values = A[4]
