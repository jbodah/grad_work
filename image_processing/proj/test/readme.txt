Super Resolution
This data set consists of a sequence of images of a car in motion.
The car struck and killed a pedestrian.  As of this writing, police
have not yet found the car nor the driver.  

The goal of this project is to combine several images of the car to
produce one or more high resolution images that could help determine
the car's make and model.  The successful completion of this project
could be a great benefit to the police.

Your project should describe the approaches considered and taken,
specific algorithms, literature citations where appropriate, and
demonstrations of your results.
